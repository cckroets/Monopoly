Monopoly
========

Creates a file of probabilities of landing on each particular space on a Monopoly game.

This is done by simulating a name of N players for M turns. 

On each turn a player rolls the dice and advances to the next space. 

If they rolled doubles they may roll again. Rolling doubles three times in a row sends the player immediately to jail.

A player may land on 'Community Chest' or 'Chance' which could send the player to a different spot on the board. 

A sample distribution is included in the 'MonopolyDist' file.
